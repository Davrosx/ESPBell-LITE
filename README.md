# ESPBell-LITE and [ESPBell-MAX](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/ESPBell-MAX)
ESPBell-LITE "IoT Intercom / Doorbell" module enables you to stay informed whenever someone rings your doorbell or presses the intercom button. Upon receiving an interactive notification, you have the convenience to either promptly open the door or choose to dismiss the alert by simply tapping the button within the notification. See the screenshot below.

## Before you start
> [!NOTE]
> I hope that everything is crystal clear as I've made every effort to provide a step-by-step explanation of the setup process. If you have any further questions regarding the setup or require assistance with assembling a printed circuit board, feel free to open a new discussion topic in the dedicated tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're new to ESP-related matters, please refrain from asking basic questions like "how to program ESP8266". There are already plenty of excellent tutorials available on the internet. If you encounter any issues, remember that providing detailed information about the problem will help me offer more effective assistance. More information equals better help!

> [!WARNING]
> I would strongly advise against attempting to assemble this PCB on your own if you have no experience "0%" in soldering, or working with ESP / Arduino boards.
> Connecting ESPBell-LITE to your intercom or doorbell demands a certain level of electronics expertise and the proficiency to utilize a multimeter effectively. Please be aware that I cannot assume responsibility for any errors or issues that may arise. My role is to provide guidance and advice to the best of my abilities.

## PCB Assembly
This project is open-source, allowing you to assemble ESPBell-MAX on your own. To simplify this process, I've provided an "Interactive HTML Boom File" located in the PCB folder. This interactive file helps you identify where to solder each component and polarity, reducing the chances of errors to a minimum. But if you don't feel confident in assembling it yourself, you can always opt to purchase a pre-assembled board from my [Shop](https://www.pricelesstoolkit.com)

## ESPHome YAML Configuration
The beauty of ESPHome is in its simplicity, you just need to change one config the "Delay" time. After you click open in the notification it will keep the relay engaged until the delay has elapsed.

```yaml

# Door Lock Opener "Momentary Switch" Keeps SSR ON for 1.5s.
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 5
    id: Lock
    name: "Lock"
    icon: "mdi:lock"
    restore_mode: ALWAYS_OFF
    on_turn_on:
    - delay: 1500ms 
    - switch.turn_off: Lock

```

## Uploading the ESPHome Firmware
> [!NOTE]
> Ready-made boards already come with ESPHome firmware flashed, so you don't need to reprogram it via USB. All settings are done through WI-FI.
> Just connect to the Hotspot `ESPBell-LITE Fallback Hotspot` through your mobile phone, and fill in your Wi-Fi credentials. After that notification will pop up in the ESPHome control panel, which will allow you to import the full configuration automatically.

To upload the firmware into ESPBell-LITE you will need two things.
- Regular USB-TTL 3.3v adapter. I have [open-source USB-TTL](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/UNIProg_Programmer) project, in case you donâ€™t have a TTL adapter yet and want to assemble it yourself.
- Pogo pin Clamp Fixture "single row 6 Pin 2.54mm spacing" or you can solder wires directly to ESPBell-MAX for programming.

## Wiring diagram ESPBell-LITE to Intercom | Doorbell

### _Intercom_
<details>
  <summary>Differences Between 4+N and 1+N Intercom Systems. Click here</summary>

In the world of intercom systems, two common configurations stand out: 4+N and 1+N. Understanding the distinctions between these setups is crucial for successful installation and operation. Here's a quick overview:

4+N Intercom Systems:

In a 4+N system, the "4" signifies the presence of four distinct wires, each with a specific purpose.
These four wires are typically allocated as follows: one for the microphone, one for the speaker, one for the doorbell, and one for the lock.
Additionally, the "N" wire represents the neutral wire, which is used for the electrical current's return path.
4+N systems offer separate wiring and control for microphone, speaker, doorbell, and lock functions.

1+N Intercom Systems:

In contrast, a 1+N system streamlines the wiring process by combining audio communication and power supply over a single wire.
The "1" in 1+N indicates that one wire is used for both audio communication and power transmission.
Like 4+N systems, the "N" wire in 1+N systems also stands for the neutral wire.
1+N systems simplify wiring, using a single wire for audio and power, making installation more straightforward.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only the 4+N Intercom system is supported by ESPBell-LITE. But if you want you can connect ESPBell-LITE to the unsupported intercom buttons directly!

### _Doorbell_

</details>

> [!WARNING]
> If there is current leakage between contacts 1 and 2 see "Dorbell wiring diagram" ESPBell-LITE will not work properly "The current flow may be due to the installed light bulb in the doorbell button which can trigger ESPBell-LITE early" So before you start itâ€™s better to check it with a multimeter.
