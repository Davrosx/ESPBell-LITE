# ESPBell-LITE and [ESPBell-MAX](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/ESPBell-MAX)
ESPBell-LITE "IoT Intercom / Doorbell" module enables you to stay informed whenever someone rings your doorbell or presses the intercom button. Upon receiving an interactive notification, you have the convenience to either promptly open the door or choose to dismiss the alert by simply tapping the button within the notification. See the screenshot below.

## Before you start
> [!NOTE]
> I trust that everything is crystal clear as I've made every effort to provide a step-by-step explanation of the setup process. If you have any further questions regarding the setup or require assistance with assembling a printed circuit board, feel free to open a new discussion topic in the dedicated tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're new to ESP-related matters, please refrain from asking basic questions like "how to program ESP8266". There are already plenty of excellent tutorials available on the internet. If you encounter any issues, remember that providing detailed information about the problem will help me offer more effective assistance. More information equals better help!

> [!WARNING]
> I would strongly advise against attempting to assemble this PCB on your own if you have no experience "0%" in soldering, or working with ESP / Arduino boards.
> Connecting ESPBell-MAX to your intercom or doorbell demands a certain level of electronics expertise and the proficiency to utilize a multimeter effectively. Please be aware that I cannot assume responsibility for any errors or issues that may arise. My role is to provide guidance and advice to the best of my abilities.

## PCB Assembly
This project is open-source, allowing you to assemble ESPBell-MAX on your own. To simplify this process, I've provided an "Interactive HTML Boom File" located in the PCB folder. This interactive file helps you identify where to solder each component and polarity, reducing the chances of errors to a minimum. But if you don't feel confident in assembling it yourself, you can always opt to purchase a pre-assembled board from my [Shop](https://www.pricelesstoolkit.com)
